        <h2>Important</h2>
        <p>This test project is set up using <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/">MbUnit</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a>. When you start writing tests, you'll probably need to add a project reference to the other project.</p>
        <p>You may want to exclude the Dependencies folder from your project, and add it as a Solution Folder. This is a helpful organization technique. The folder and the files need to be on disk, but they do not need to be explicitly part of your project.</p>
        <p>After you are finished with the Documentation you can delete the Documentation directory from your project.</p>

        <h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>In order to run tests you will need to set up your environment to do so. This 
    project is &quot;prepped&quot; to use Gallio as a test runner, but assumes that you have 
    it set up on your computer. Please read on to get going with Gallio.</p>
        <p>Gallio is a test runner that will integrate with Visual Studio and/or Resharper to run the tests in this project. It also has a standalone Windows GUI program and a command line test runner.</p>
<p>If you have ReSharper, I would highly recommend installing both Gallio and the ReSharper plugin.</p>
