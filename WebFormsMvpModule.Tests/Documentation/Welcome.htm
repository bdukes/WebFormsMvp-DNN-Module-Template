        <h2>* Important *</h2>
        <p>This test project is set up using <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/">MbUnit</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a>. When you start writing tests, you'll probably need to add a project reference to the other project.</p>
        <p>You may want to exclude the Dependencies folder from your project, and add it as a Solution Folder. This is a helpful organization technique. The folder and the files need to be on disk, but they do not need to be explicitly part of your project.</p>
        <p>After you are finished with the Documentation you can delete the Documentation directory from your project.</p>
